<br/>

You've just received the Trace mascot. You have joined the TraceAcrossTheWorld team as they embark on the crazy adventure of **touring the world with it!**

Here are a few rules to help you understand how you can help us!

-   This is Trace's **next destination**:

<br/>
<div className="text-center" style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', minHeight: '5vh' }}>
      <div>
        <NextCity/>
      </div>
</div>

<br/>

-   Are you **going in the right direction** in the next few days? **Keep Trace with you** and take it forward as best you can.
    It's okay if you don't make it exactly to the next destination. The important thing is **to get Trace moving in the right direction.**\
    Even a few kilometers are a big help to Trace!
    On the way, it would be great if you could make a little video of yourself with the Trace mascot in front of a place you particularly like and would like to show us!
      And remember: **Trace doesn't fly!**

-   You don't think you can help Trace move forward? No worries! Go directly to the next step.

</div><br/>

-   Now it's time to **pass the baton.** Look for someone you know who will go in the right direction to **bring Trace closer to his next destination.**

-   You don't know anyone able to help us? You have three options

<br/>
<Stack spacing={2} alignItems="center">
  <Item className="contour-ombre" style={{ width: "100%", textAlign: "center"}}>
    Contact the <a href="https://chat.whatsapp.com/FKwW0q23yVk3OdKNKAxGnE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WhatsApp group</a>. <br /> We may be able to help you find someone close to you to help you move Trace forward.  
</Item>
  <Item className="contour-ombre" style={{ width: "100%", textAlign: "center"}}>
    Go to the nearest<a href="https://www.hostelworld.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">youth hostel</a> and explain the project to the people there. <br /> There's sure to be some travelers interested in taking part in the adventure!  
</Item>
  <Item className="contour-ombre" style={{ width: "100%", textAlign: "center"}}>
    Go back a few miles to find someone who might be interested! Better to step back to pass the baton than to stop!  
</Item>
</Stack>

<br/>
<br/>

-   When you pass on the mascot, be sure to give it to **someone motivated by the project.** Show her this site with all the explanations so that she has all the information she needs to continue the adventure!

-   Before you leave, take a photo of the two of you with the mascot and send it to us <a href="https://www.instagram.com/traceacrosstheworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>!

<h2 style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>Special cases</h2>

<br/>

-   Trace has decided not to fly on this journey. To cross the seas, you'll have to find a dedicated sailor in the nearest port!

-   If you have any questions, feel free to send an e-mail to<a href="mailto:traceacrosstheworld@gmail.com"></a> (traceacrosstheworld@gmail.com) or post a message on the project's <a href="https://chat.whatsapp.com/FKwW0q23yVk3OdKNKAxGnE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WhatsApp</a>!
