# Overview

Welcome to the "Trace across the world" project

### Objective

The Trace mascot is equipped with a tracking system that allows it to be followed around the globe. Leaving Lyon in France on XX/XX/2023, Trace is touring the world, passing from hand to hand the carriers that take her around.


### How does this work?

Trace's itinerary is well-defined, passing through symbolic stopover towns around the world.

Mind you, Trace has decided to make this long trip without flying. We'll have to take the boat to cross the oceans!

### Did you get the Trace mascot?

Get it moving in the right direction towards the next stage, then entrust it to a trusted and motivated person, who will also take it forward a few kilometers.
No matter how long it takes, from carrier to carrier, Trace will make his way from on destination to the next.
Don't know who to give the mascot to? Connect to the [WhatsApp]group (https://chat.whatsapp.com/FKwW0q23yVk3OdKNKAxGnE), and the Trace team will help you find the next carrier!





### Are you close to one of the route main stops?

Well done, get to the indicated place as quickly as possible, then take a photo or video of Trace with you in front of the place symbolizing the leg. We'll then put together a film with all the photos and videos from the project!

## And what about the team?

Once you've relayed the mascot, you're part of the "Trace across the world" team. You can return to the site regularly to follow its progress around the world.

If you know anyone in the Trace area, you can put them in touch with the carrier via the team's [WhatsApp](https://chat.whatsapp.com/FKwW0q23yVk3OdKNKAxGnE) group. Perhaps this will enable us to find a future relay worker to take Trace a little further towards its next stage.

Finally, as a carrier, don't hesitate to send us some photos/videos of you with Trace on the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/traceacrosstheworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram account</a> at places close to where you are.

As a security measure, the displayed location is approximately 2km away, so that the carrier cannot be accurately located.
