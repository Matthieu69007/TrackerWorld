The Trace mascot is equipped with an Apple AirTag to track its location. If you own an iPhone, you may receive a message explaining that an AirTag not belonging to you is near you.

<br/>
To respect the anonymity and privacy of Trace wearers, the position displayed on the site is randomly generated within a 2 km radius of the mascot's location.
<br/>
As part of the European GDPR, you can request the deletion of the location data. Email <a href="mailto:traceacrosstheworld@gmail.com">TraceAcrossTheWorld</a> specifying the period during which you were in possession of the Trace mascot.
