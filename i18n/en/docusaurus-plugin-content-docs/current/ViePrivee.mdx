# Privacy

The Trace mascot is **equipped with an AirTag** to track its position. If you own an iPhone, you may receive a message explaining that an AirTag not belonging to you is near you.

To **respect the anonymity and privacy** of Trace wearers, the position displayed on the site is generated **randomly within a 2 km** radius of the mascot's position.

As part of the European RGPD regulation, you can request the deletion of location data. Send an e-mail to<a href="mailto:traceacrosstheworld@gmail.com"></a> , specifying the period during which you were in possession of the Trace mascot.
