# Privacy

The Trace mascot is equipped with an Apple AirTag to track its location. If you own an Iphone, you can receive a message that an AirTag does not belong to you is close to you.

<br/>
To respect Trace bearers privacy, the positions displayed are randomly spread up to 2Â km away from the mascot actual position.
<br/>
As part of the European GDPR, you can request the deletion of the location data. Email <a href="mailto:traceacrosstheworld@gmail.com">TraceAcrossTheWorld</a> specifying the period during which you were in possession of the Trace mascot.
