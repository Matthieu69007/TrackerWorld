# Overview

Welcome to the "Trace across the world" project

### Objective

The Trace mascot is equipped with a tracking system that allows it to be followed around the globe. Leaving Lyon in France on XX/XX/2023, Trace is touring the world, passing from hand to hand the carriers that take her around.

### How does this work?

Trace's itinerary is well-defined, passing through symbolic stopover towns around the world.

Mind you, Trace has decided to make this long trip without flying. We'll have to take the boat to cross the oceans!
