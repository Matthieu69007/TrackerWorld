# Overview

Welcome to the "Trace across the world" project

### Objective

The Trace mascot is equipped with **a tracking system** to follow its trail around the globe. Setting out from Lyon in France in October 2023, **Trace will travel around the world**, passing **from hand to hand among the carriers** who will take her on her journey.

### How does it work?

The Trace itinerary is defined and **passes through symbolic** stopover towns around the world.

Mind you, Trace has decided to make this long journey **without flying** and will have to **take the boat** to cross the oceans!
