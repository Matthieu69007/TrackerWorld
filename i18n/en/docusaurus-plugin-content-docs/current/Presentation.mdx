# Overview

Welcome to the "Trace across the world" project

Frigyes Karinthy claimed in 1929 that we're all within ["six handshakes"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation) of anyone else on Earth.
 But how many handshakes does it take to go around the world?

It is from this premise that the project "Trace across the world" was born.

## Objective

The Trace mascot is equipped with a tracking system that allows it to be followed around the globe. Leaving Lyon, France, on XX/XX/2023, Trace will circumnavigate the globe, passing from hand to hand. It is the thread that connects the carriers, each of whom takes it a few kilometers further.

</div>

## How does this work?

Trace plans to visit a number of symbolic locations around the world. Certain stages are defined, but the adventure is up to you.

### Did you get the Trace mascot?

Get it moving in the right direction towards the next stage, then entrust it to a trusted and motivated person, who will also take it forward a few kilometers.
No matter how long it takes, from carrier to carrier, Trace will make his way from on destination to the next.
Don't know who to give the mascot to? Connect to the [WhatsApp]group (https://chat.whatsapp.com/FKwW0q23yVk3OdKNKAxGnE), and the Trace team will help you find the next carrier!

### Are you close to one of the route main stops?

Well done, get to the indicated place as quickly as possible, then take a photo or video of Trace with you in front of the place symbolizing the leg. We'll then put together a film with all the photos and videos from the project!

</div>

## And what about the team?

Once you've relayed the mascot, you're part of the "Trace across the world" team. You can return to the site regularly to follow its progress around the world.

If you know anyone in the Trace area, you can put them in touch with the carrier via the team's [WhatsApp](https://chat.whatsapp.com/FKwW0q23yVk3OdKNKAxGnE) group. Perhaps this will enable us to find a future relay worker to take Trace a little further towards its next stage.

Finally, as a carrier, don't hesitate to send us some photos/videos of you with Trace on the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/traceacrosstheworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram account</a> at places close to where you are.

## How to follow ?

Thanks to the chip installed inside Trace, the whole team can follow its progress around the world.

<div className="custom-container" style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <Link
    className="button button--secondary button--lg"
    style={{ width: "auto", textAlign: "center", backgroundColor: "#eaeaea"}}
    to="/docs/Itinerary">

  </Link>
</div>

As a security measure, the displayed location is approximately 2km away, so that the carrier cannot be accurately located.
